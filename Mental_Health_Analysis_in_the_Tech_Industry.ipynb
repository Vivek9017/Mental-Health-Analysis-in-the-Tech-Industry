        "Mental health has become a critical concern in modern workplaces, especially within the technology industry, where high workloads, long working hours, and constant performance pressure are common. This project focuses on performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a mental health survey dataset to understand the factors influencing mental health awareness and treatment-seeking behavior among tech professionals.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in this project is survey-based and consists of 1259 responses with 27 variables. Each record represents an individual working in or related to the technology sector. The dataset includes demographic details such as age, gender, and location, along with workplace-related variables like company size, remote work availability, mental health benefits, anonymity, supervisor support, and the impact of mental health on work performance. The key target variable in the dataset is treatment, which indicates whether a respondent has sought mental health treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first phase of the project involved data understanding and data wrangling. Columns with limited analytical value or excessive missing data, such as timestamps and free-text comments, were removed. Missing values in important columns were handled using logical placeholders to avoid data loss. Inconsistent categorical values, especially in the gender variable, were standardized to improve data quality. Unrealistic age values were filtered out to ensure the dataset reflected a valid working population. These steps made the dataset clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second phase focused on visual analysis following the UBM framework—Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis.\n",
        "In univariate analysis, individual variables were examined to understand their distributions. Charts such as age distribution, gender distribution, treatment frequency, work interference levels, and availability of mental health benefits provided an overview of the dataset. These visualizations revealed that mental health treatment is almost evenly divided between those who have sought help and those who have not, highlighting ongoing stigma or hesitation around mental health care.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bivariate analysis explored relationships between two variables at a time. Numerical–categorical analysis, such as age versus treatment and age versus work interference, helped understand how mental health impact varies across age groups. Categorical–categorical analysis, including family history versus treatment and benefits versus treatment, revealed strong associations between workplace support and treatment-seeking behavior. Employees with a family history of mental illness or access to mental health benefits were more likely to seek treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the multivariate analysis, multiple variables were analyzed simultaneously using pair plots and correlation heatmaps. These analyses showed that mental health outcomes are influenced by a combination of personal, workplace, and organizational factors rather than a single variable. Work interference, mental health benefits, and family history emerged as influential factors when analyzed together.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project concludes that workplace environment and organizational support play a crucial role in mental health treatment decisions. While demographic factors like age and gender provide context, policies such as mental health benefits, anonymity, and supportive leadership have a stronger impact on employee well-being. The insights gained from this analysis can help organizations design better mental health policies, promote awareness, and create a more supportive work culture.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this project demonstrates how structured data analysis and visualization can be used to uncover meaningful insights from real-world data, supporting informed decision-making in the area of employee mental health."
